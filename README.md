MyGPT is a fully functional and customizable AI chatbot built using React, powered by the Google Gemini API, and styled with AssistantUI to replicate and enhance the user experience of ChatGPT. This project is designed to bring conversational AI to your fingertips, providing an interface where users can interact with a powerful language model in real time.

The main goal behind MyGPT is to create a lightweight yet powerful personal assistant that offers intuitive conversations, clear UI/UX, and seamless integration with Google's Gemini large language model. Unlike generic chatbot UIs, MyGPT incorporates AssistantUI, giving it a polished and modern look that closely mirrors the feel of a production-ready chat assistant like ChatGPT.
